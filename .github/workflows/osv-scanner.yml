# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# A sample workflow which sets up periodic OSV-Scanner scanning for vulnerabilities,
# in addition to a PR check which fails if new vulnerabilities are introduced.
#
# For more examples and options, including how to ignore specific vulnerabilities,
